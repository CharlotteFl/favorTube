# FavorTube - Readme

## 1 Introduction

"FavorTube" is a Web3 platform that provides full life-cycle services for content creation. It connects content creators, consumers, and fans on the same decentralized platform, providing content creators with a full life-cycle platform from early fundraising to revenue realization.

When storing user data on a decentralized network, the ownership of the data remains with the users. Using blockchain and smart contracts automates the allocation of rights and revenue between content creators and promoters and ensures that it is transparent and fair. This solves the problem of the unequal distribution of rights and revenue between content creators and Web2 streaming media platforms while releasing the passion and creativity of creators. In addition, NFT casting and a trading marketplace are built into FavorTube, which provides a one-stop solution for content creators that want to raise funds in the early stage, and for fans who want to participate in investment and share creative income.

## 2 Features

##### Fully Decentralized

The fully decentralized resource pool for storage, content distribution, databases, and transactions, with the mobile terminal directly connected without gateways

##### Download and Use

Ready-to-use desktop and mobile APPs take blockchain from a specialized niche market to a consumer mass market

##### Consumers-grade User Experience

Real-time HD video playback is implemented over P2P networks, with the performance increased as the network scales expanded

##### Support for Commercial Media Storage

Authorized data access over P2P networks is implemented to meet the requirements of commercial data storage on decentralized networks

##### Creation as Revenue

Content creators create and upload videos and earn revenue when consumers subscribe to their channels or content

##### Earning while Watching

Revenue from consumers viewing ads on the platform is automatically distributed among creators, the platform, and viewers via smart contracts

##### Empowering the Value of NFTs

NFTs can generate ongoing revenue by participating in crowdfunding, which can also be resold for revenue

##### Anti-censorship and Non-isolated Data

Consumers have access to all the global data, while content producers can get revenue globally

##### Crowdfunding Implemented by NFTs 

One-click NFT offering sells multiple forms of NFTs (permanent membership cards, crowdfunding revenue vouchers), and channels or content revenue are automatically distributed based on the NFTs

##### DAO Content Review

Content is reviewed by DAO organization, and auditors are randomly assigned on the chain. If more than 2/3 agree, the content will be automatically blocked on the chain.

## 3 FavorX Chain

"FavorTube" is based on the labâ€™s "FavorX Chain" public chain and technical solution. "FavorX Chain" is a theoretically and practically proven solution, the basic idea of which is to decompose the functions with different security, performance and cost requirements and place them on different subchains, and assist with the requirements of complete Web 3 applications through multiple subchains. Since data storage and content chain are required for almost all Web 3 applications, there are built-in subchains for data storage and content distribution in FavorXChain.

After FavorTube used FavorXChain's storage matching subchain and content distribution subchain, it added a database subchain to meet the storage requirements of structured data, and also defined the access protocols for file access, channel management, and metadata on these subchains. FavorX Chain will be used as a separate project in the future to provide the underlying support for various Web 3 applications, which implements decentralized transactions, storage, and content distribution on the basis and forms the decentralized basic cloud service for Web 3. It provides a high-performance subchain interface that users can use to implement their own computational subchains for specific needs, such as database subchains. In this way, FavorX Chain can provide a fully decentralized implementation plan for almost all Web 3 applications.
